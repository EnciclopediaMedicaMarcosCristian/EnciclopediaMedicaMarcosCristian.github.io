Hello, we are Marcos Sánchez Rosillo
and Cristian Martínez Hernández,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.920
students of Biomedical Engineering at the
University of Alicante, and in this presentation,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.320
we will explain what color blindness is, its types,
genetic causes, and how it affects color perception

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.560
in people who have it. In this slide, I’ll give a brief
introduction on what color blindness is.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.560
Color blindness is a visual disorder that
affects the way people perceive colors.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.200
Basically, those who have it
struggle to distinguish certain colors,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.560
especially between red and green.
This disorder was first studied by

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.600
John Dalton, a scientist who, interestingly,
was also colorblind. His research gave

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.960
this condition its name and led
to a better understanding in the scientific field.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.960
As for its causes, color blindness has
a significant genetic component. Most cases are

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.960
inherited in a recessive manner through
the X chromosome, which makes it more common in

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.040
men, as they have only one X chromosome and,
if it is affected, they manifest the condition.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.440
There are different types of color blindness,
each related to the lack of perception of certain colors.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.040
Protanopia implies difficulty in seeing red,
while deuteranopia affects

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.520
the perception of green. Tritanopia
causes problems in distinguishing

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.280
blue. Finally, achromatism is the most extreme case,
where one only sees in black, white, or gray tones.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.080
These types vary in intensity and affect
how each person perceives the world.
